    <abstract>In Turkey and around the world today, we are witnessing the eclipse of the progressive and emancipatory discourse of modernity. Some of us view the spectacle with melancholyâ€”yet it has also produced a remarkably lively and pluralist climate in which new voices are being heard and deeply entrenched assumptions are being radically and, we believe, irreversibly challenged. At the center of the most heated theoretical debates in many disciplines is the question of whether it is possible to undertake a rigorous critique of the Enlightenment project of modernity without surrendering its liberating and humanist premises.</abstract>
