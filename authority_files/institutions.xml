		<name>The Cato Institute</name>
		<blurb>Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a nonpartisan public policy research foundation headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Institute is named for Cato&#039;s Letters, libertarian pamphlets that helped lay the philosophical foundation for the American Revolution. The Cato Institute seeks to broaden the parameters of public policy debate to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the traditional American principles of limited government, individual liberty, and peace. Toward that goal, the Institute strives to involve the intelligent, concerned lay public in questions of policy and the proper role of government. The Cato Institute undertakes an extensive publications program dealing with the complete spectrum of policy issues. Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned to examine the federal budget, Social Security, monetary policy, natural resource policy, military spending, regulation, NATO, international trade, and myriad other issues. Major policy conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal. The Institute also publishes the quarterly magazine Regulation.</blurb>

		<name>The International Institute for Strategic Studies</name>
		<blurb>The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) is the world&#039;s leading authority on political-military conflict.The IISS, based in London, is both a limited company in UK law and a registered charity. It has offices in the US and in Singapore with charitable status in each jurisdiction.The IISS was founded in 1958 in the UK by a number of individuals interested in how to maintain civilised international relations in the nuclear age. Much of the Institute&#039;s early work focused on nuclear deterrence and arms control and was hugely influential in setting the intellectual structures for managing the Cold War.The Institute grew dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, expanding both because of the nature of its work and its geographical scope. Its mandate became to look at the problems of conflict, however caused, that might have an important military content. This gave fresh impetus to the Institute as it began to cover more comprehensively political and military issues in all continents. As this mandate developed, the Institute worked hard both to provide the best information and analysis on strategic trends, and to facilitate contacts between government leaders, business people and analysts that would lead to the development of better public policy in the fields of international relations and international security.The IISS is the primary source of accurate, objective information on international strategic issues for politicians and diplomats, foreign affairs analysts, international business, economists, the military, defence commentators, journalists, academics and the informed public. The Institute owes no allegiance to any government, or to any political or other organisation.The Institute&#039;s high-profile publications are both timely and authoritative. They are universally regarded as providing the best independent, internationally sourced information and commentary on the main strategic events touching on national, regional and global security.The Institute&#039;s conference activities are considered to be at the forefront of public policy development, especially given that its convening power is such that it can often bring government officials and others together in formats and circumstances that they could not easily manage for themselves.The Institute&#039;s staff and governing boards are international and its network of some 2,500 Individual Members and 450 Corporate and Institutional Members is drawn from more than 100 countries. The IISS, through its various activities, seeks to provide excellent information and analysis that can improve wider public understanding of international security problems and through its network, influence the development of sounder public policy.</blurb>

		<blurb>Since joining the New School for Social Research in 1991, the World Policy Institute has adapted its traditional mission of policy research and advocacy on critical world problems to the New School&#039;s tradition of creative adult education. It has done so at a time when the traditional subject of international diplomacy and world politics itself is being transformed by dramatic world changes from the end of the Cold War to the increasing blurring of the line between domestic and international concerns. Accordingly, the Institute has both redefined its agenda and broadened its mission.</blurb>

Meeting in private as individuals, rather than as representatives of governments or institutions, Pugwash participants exchange views and explore alternative approaches to arms control and tension reduction with a combination of candor, continuity, and flexibility seldom attained in official East-West and North-South discussions and negotiations. Yet, because of the stature of many of the Pugwash participants in their own countries (as, for example, science and arms-control advisers to governments, key figures in academies of science and universities, and former and future holders of high government office), insights from Pugwash discussions tend to penetrate quickly to the appropriate levels of official policy-making.</blurb>

In its conferences and activities, it serves as a bridge between scholarship and public policy bringing new knowledge to the attention of decision makers and affording scholars a better insight into public policy issues. The Institution traces its beginnings to 1916 with the founding of the Institute for Government Research, the first private organization devoted to public policy issues at the national level. In 1922 and 1924, the Institute was joined by two supporting sister organizations, the Institute of Economics and the Robert Brookings Graduate School. In 1927, these three groups were consolidated into one institution, named in honor of Robert Somers Brookings (1850-1932), a St. Louis businessman whose leadership shaped the earlier organizations. Brookings is financed largely by endowment and by the support of philanthropic foundations, corporations, and private individuals. Its funds are devoted to carrying out its own research and educational activities. It also undertakes some unclassified government contract studies, reserving the right to publish its findings.</blurb>

		<name>International Security Information Service</name>
		<blurb>The International Security Information Service (ISIS) was founded in 1989 in London to provide factual information and analysis on issues of international defence and security to parliamentarians and other interested parties. Its primary purpose has been to improve the level of understanding of these complex issues, enhance the quality of parliamentary debate in particular, and hence to help to hold the British Government to account for its foreign and defence policies. In August 1995, ISIS expanded its operation to Brussels where it established a parallel organisation, ISIS Europe, to provide a similar service to a wider European audience. ISIS Europe aim to improve the quality and range of defence and security issues discussed within and between the institutions with competencies in foreign affairs and security policy in Brussels and, increasingly, in other western and eastern European national parliaments. One of the principal means which ISIS adopts to inform and influence parliamentarians is the publication of briefing papers. These briefings and reports are prepared by experts from material collected from public sources. They are freely and openly available to politicians, civil servants, journalists and others interested in this area of public affairs. Since it was established in September 1995, ISIS Europe has published eighteen such briefings and eleven shorter briefings on developments in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) negotiations to amend the Maastricht Treaty. ISIS Europe&#039;s specialist reports are customised for, and targeted at, key individuals and committees within the UK and many European parliaments. In order to maximise the impact of its analysis, ISIS employs methods that ensure the material is read by the right person at the most appropriate time. This requires good analytical judgement, personal contact and a trusted relationship with its clientele, and a thorough knowledge of legislative procedures and agendas. Over the past year ISIS Europe has sought to develop its contacts in central and eastern European parliaments. It is on the basis of this experience that ISIS Europe is now engaged in a research project which examines the role of the parliaments of Central and Eastern European states in influencing and scrutinising foreign and defence policy. ISIS Europe also engages actively in the work of the European Parliament, acting as a consultancy service to many of its Members and co-ordinating inter-party support for specific initiatives in the field of defence and security. For example it co-ordinates fortnightly inter-party meetings to discuss current legislative initiatives and monthly meetings of the Parliament&#039;s Arms Transfers Working Group. This group aims to influence the process of developing stricter European arms export controls and explores ways in which the EU can address the issues of surplus light weapons, illicit trafficking in conventional arms, and the furtherance &#039;of security first&#039; development assistance policies.</blurb>

The institute&#039;s purpose is to study the causes of international conflict and the opportunities to resolve it through international cooperation. During IGCC&#039;s first five years, research focused largely on the issue of averting nuclear war through arms control and confidence-building measures between the superpowers. Since then the research program has diversified to encompass several broad areas of inquiry: regional relations, international environmental policy, international relations theory, and most recently the domestic sources of foreign policy. IGCC serves as a liaison between the academic and policy communities, injecting fresh ideas into the policy process, establishing the intellectual foundations for effective policy-making in the post-Cold War environment, and providing opportunities and incentives for UC faculty and students to become involved in international policy debates. Scholars, researchers, government officials, and journalists from the United States and abroad participate in all IGCC projects, and IGCC&#039;s publications-books, policy papers, and a semiannual newsletter-are widely distributed to individuals and institutions around the world.</blurb>

The Commission has examined the principal causes of deadly ethnic, nationalist, and religious conflicts within and between states and the circumstances that foster or deter their outbreak. Taking a long-term, worldwide view of violent conflicts that are likely to emerge, it seeks to determine the functional requirements of an effective system for preventing mass violence and to identify the ways in which such a system could be implemented. The Commission looks at the strengths and weaknesses of various international entities in conflict prevention and considers ways in which international organizations might contribute toward developing an effective international system of nonviolent problem solving.</blurb>

It analyzes the contemporary political world, with a strong emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach: its research fellows include not only political scientists but also economists, sociologists, historians and anthropologists. The CERI has a twofold objective: to contribute to an in-depth understanding of political societies abroad and the dynamics of the world system; to provide expert analysis on today&#039;s major international issues. Its topics of study are issues central to international relations research, including: globalization, forms of regional integration - particularly the building of the European Union - new forms of conflict, democratization, migrations, nationalism and other political identities. Its relations with the international scientific community are essential to the CERI&#039;s research activity: hosting foreign scholars, participating in international programs, attending major world conferences. The Russia Papers are published by the Center for International Studies and Research (CERI) at Sciences Po University in Paris. The Editor is Marie Mendras. The series offers original analyses on Russia in the fields of internal politics, economic affairs, demographic and social issues, culture and identity, and foreign policy. In a comparative and regional perspective, The Russia Papers are open to studies on other former Soviet republics.</blurb>

		<name>Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, St. Andrews University, Scotland</name>
		<blurb>The center is concerned not only with the study of terrorism and related forms of political violence, but also with other nontraditional modes of international conflict including various manifestations of intercommunal ethnic strife, multinational peacekeeping and peace enforcement, and the grey area between political conflict and criminal activity. Its major goals are to investigate the roots of political violence; develop a body of theory spanning its various and disparate elements; and recommend policy and organizational initiatives that the government and private sectors might adopt to better predict, detect, and respond to the threats and challenges of the post-cold war era. The centre&#039;s work is largely facilitated through its possession and amalgamation of two of the world&#039;s pre-eminent database sources on terrorism and political violence: The RAND-St. Andrews University Databases on Terrorism and Low-Intensity Conflict and the collection of materials on 20th century conflict donated by Control Risks Ltd. Both of these resources consist of newspaper clippings and journal articles from more than 100 countries and in 5 languages. In addition, material from The RAND-St. Andrews databases is also organised in 9 online, specialised computerised &quot;chronologies&quot;, where terrorist incidents and other acts of politically-motivated violence are listed in chronological format and coded for rapid data retrieval. The largest and best know of these is The RAND Chronology of International Terrorism. It contains information on international terrorist incidents since 1968 derived from the open literature (as are all the databases); newspapers, journals, published government reports and documents, radio broadcasts, and the foreign press. It provides a comprehensive, independent source of information with which trends in various aspects of terrorism can be analyzed. In response to the governmental, military, scholarly, and public need for such a resource, a Chronology of International Terrorism is published annually.</blurb>

The editors of the founding series are members of the management board. In the meantime, a few further papers joined the network. ERPA&#039;s aim is to provide a common access point for the online working paper series of the participating institutions in order to help researchers in the field of European Integration studies searching the growing number of working papers now available in the internet. ERPA is confined to high quality series in order to guarantee high standards. The participating series editors achieve this high level of scholarship by different means: while the Max Planck Institute, and the Harvard Jean Monnet Chair practise high-level internal refereeing, the Robert Schuman Centre and the EIoP have a double-blind review process with two referees per paper. All further participating series subscribe to a similar high-quality policy.</blurb>

		<name>Project on Defense Alternatives</name>
		<blurb>Since its inception in 1991, the Project on Defense Alternatives has sought to adapt security policy to the challenges and opportunities of the post-Cold War era. Toward this end it promotes consideration of the broadest range of defense options. Central to its mission is the development of &quot;transitional security policy,&quot; which would serve to create conditions favorable to the advent of regional and global cooperative security regimes. In the Project&#039;s perspective a transitional security policy would: Guarantee reliable, cost-effective defense against aggression; Rely on military structures that do not contribute to interstate tensions, crisis instability, or arms racing; Allow significant reductions in the level of armed forces and military spending; Foster progress in arms control and in the gradual demilitarization of international relations; and, Facilitate an increasing reliance on collective and global peacekeeping agencies and nonmilitary means of conflict prevention, containment, and resolution. In its approach to security issues the Project seeks to uniquely combine pragmatism and vision. Although proceeding from a common security perspective, PDA pays careful attention to concerns about current military threats and requirements. The Project is premised on the belief that policy innovation can overcome the practical obstacles to progress toward more cooperative security postures - however, it sees the prerequisite of innovation to be a close and critical engagement in the mainstream security policy debate. Although PDA emphasizes the reformulation of US defense policy, it has contributed since its inception to the development of defense alternatives for NATO and has pioneered proposals for the &quot;defensive restructuring&quot; of armed forces in Eastern Europe, Russia, and the developing world. As part of this latter effort, the Project has designed arms control measures that would reduce the offensive character of existing conventional armed forces and reorient military assistance programs along defensive lines.</blurb>

The Institute&#039;s research should seek to contribute to &quot;the understanding of the preconditions for a stable peace and for peaceful solutions of international conflicts&quot; and the Commission recommended that research be concentrated on armaments, their limitation and reduction, and arms control. The Commission also recommended that SIPRI work be of &quot;an applied research character directed toward practical-political questions [which] should be carried on in a constant interchange with research of a more theoretical kind.&quot;</blurb>

		<name>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</name>
		<blurb>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is a Paris-based intergovernmental organisation whose purpose is to provide its 29 Member countries with a forum in which governments can compare their experiences, discuss the problems they share and seek solutions which can then be applied within their own national contexts. The Organisation is thus entirely at the service of its Member countries. It forms a homogeneous entity in that each Member country is committed to the principles of the market economy and pluralistic democracy. The fundamental task of the OECD is straightforward: namely to enable its members to consult and co-operate with each other in order to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth in their countries and improve the economic and social well-being of their populations. The OECD offers advice and makes recommendations to its members to help them to define their policies. On occasion its also arbitrates negotiations of multilateral agreements and establishes legal codes in certain areas of activity. The Organisation is a forum for objective, skilled and independent dialogue which permits a thorough understanding and true assessment of the problems posed in today&#039;s increasingly complex world. The great comparative advantages of the OECD are its multidisciplinary approach--a capacity to cover all areas of government activity in a consistent way--and its system of consensus building through peer pressure. Within the different committees the peer pressure system encourages countries to be transparent, to provide explanations and justifications, and to be self-critical where necessary, the practice of self-assessment being the most original characteristic of the OECD.</blurb>

		<name>South Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons</name>
		<blurb>The South Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC) was launched on 08 May 2002 in Belgrade. SEESAC is a component of the Regional Implementation Plan on Combating the Proliferations of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) formulated and adopted by the Stability Pact in November 2001, with the aims of stopping the flow and availability of SALW in the region, consolidating achievements so far and supporting the socio-economic conditions for peace and development in South East Europe. The uncontrolled proliferation and illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) is a serious problem in South Eastern Europe. SALW proliferation has fuelled crime and insecurity, exacerbating conflict in the region and undermining post conflict peace-building. Problems related to SALW are likely to pose a serious constraint to economic and social development in South Eastern Europe. Established in co-operation with the UNDP and housed in their offices in Belgrade, SEESAC worked to support the Stability Pact Regional Implementation Plan for an initial period of three years; the impact of the project has led to a further two-year extension until December 2006. Political and strategic guidance and indigenous support for SEESAC is provided by a Regional Steering Group (RSG), which is composed of representatives of the governments of the states concerned, the Stability Pact, UNDP and observers from institutions such as the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and civil society. The RSG meets twice yearly and has approved the 2005 SEESAC Strategy. SEESAC operates under the guidance of The Regional Steering Group for Small Arms and Light Weapons and the UN Resident Co-ordinator in Belgrade. SEESAC liaises directly with governments and civil society, providing technical input, information exchange, co-ordination and overview of current and future efforts and fund-raising assistance for specific SALW projects. SEESAC&#039;s small team is in constant communication with all the governments involved and with the relevant international organisations, non-governmental organisations and bi-lateral donors. SEESAC&#039;s regional activities include sensitising governments and civil society on small arms issues, formulating national strategies for SALW control and incorporating small arms issues into UNDP development planning.</blurb>

		<name>United States Agency for International Development</name>
		<blurb>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the independent government agency that provides economic development and humanitarian assistance to advance U.S. economic and political interests overseas. Established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID has achieved a proud record of accomplishment. In these times of tight federal budgets, many Americans have asked, Why foreign aid? The answers are simple: the small portion of the federal budget that assists developing nations is spent directly in the best interests of the United States and has produced a striking record of accomplishment. Public opinion polls on foreign assistance reveal two important trends: (1) most Americans grossly overestimate the size of America\&#039;s foreign assistance program;and (2) a strong majority of Americans believe modest assistance to the less fortunate reflects American values. In short, America is doing well by doing good through USAID\&#039;s participatory development activities. Further, USAID\&#039;s activities lead to direct economic benefits here at home in almost every state in the Union.</blurb>

		<name>Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University</name>
		<blurb>The Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (ISERP) is the research arm of the social sciences at Columbia University. ISERP&#039;s mission is to catalyze and produce pioneering social science research and to shape public policy by integrating knowledge and methods across the social science disciplines. The Institute supports a collaborative interdisciplinary community through seminars and research centers; a seed grants program and working paper series; technical and statistical assistance for faculty research; support for grant application and administration; and development and management of large-scale collaborative projects. ISERP also offers social science training at the master&#039;s, doctoral, and postdoctoral level. ISERP is the direct descendant of the pathbreaking Bureau for Applied Social Research (BASR), established at Columbia in 1944 by the sociologist Paul F. Lazarsfeld. One of the first social science institutes in the nation, the Bureau made landmark contributions to communications research, public opinion polling, organizational studies, and social science methodology. BASR&#039;s tradition was carried on by the Center for the Social Sciences, established in 1976 after Lazarsfeld&#039;s death and later renamed to honor him. The Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences was one of the centers incorporated into the Institute at its founding in 1998. A name change in 2001 officially launched Columbia&#039;s Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy.</blurb>

		<name>The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect</name>
		<blurb>The Responsibility to Protect - known as R2P - refers to the obligation of states toward their populations and toward all populations at risk of genocide and other large-scale atrocities. This new international norm stipulates that: The primary responsibility to protect populations from mass atrocities lies with the state itself. When a state proves either unable or unwilling to protect peoples, that responsibility shifts to the international community. This obligation must be exercised preventively; states can not delay action until mass crimes have already occurred. The tools of action include diplomatic, legal, and other peaceful measures; coercive measures such as sanctions; and, as a last resort, military force. These principles originated in a 2001 report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty and were endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document paragraphs 138 and 139. The UN Secretary General released a report in January 2009 Implementing the Responsibility to Protect. In a July 2009 General Assembly Debate, UN Member States overwhelmingly reaffirmed the 2005 Commitment and passed a consensus resolution taking note of the Secretary-General&#039;s report.

		<name>Center for World-Class Universities</name>
		<blurb>The history of the study of world-class universities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University began with the founding of Institute of Higher Education in 1985. The first book (in Chinese) on world-class universities, Research on World-Class Universities edited by then director, Professor Ai Zhu Tao, was published in 1993. In 2007, the first text in English, titled World-Class University and Ranking: Aiming Beyond Status, was published. It was edited by Professor Nian Cai Liu, the director of IHE and by Dr. Jan Sadlak, the director of UNESCO - European Centre for Higher Education.In 2005, the Center for World-Class Universities (CWCU) was named as a strategic research unit by the Chinese Ministry of Education. This acknowledgment was made in recognition of its long tradition of providing high-quality consultation reports to the Chinese government on strategies for building world-class universities and other S policies. Many of these reports have attracted the attention of national leadership, government officials, university leaders and the general public.</blurb>

		<name>The Sexual Violence Research Initiative</name>
		<blurb>Sexual violence is a violation of human rights and a serious public health problem. It has a profound impact on physical and mental health, both immediately and many years after the assault. To date, sexual violence has received insufficient attention from researchers, policy-makers and programme designers and it has been a long struggle to have it recognised as a legitimate public health issue. The SVRI is an important contribution to eliminating sexual violence by simultaneously addressing the lack of research on the different aspects of sexual violence as well as drawing attention of a wide range of people including policy makers and the media, to this important public health issue.</blurb>

		<name>EGMONT - The Royal Institute for International Relations</name>
		<blurb>EGMONT-The Royal Institute for International Relations is an independent think-tank based in Brussels. Its interdisciplinary research is conducted in a spirit of total academic freedom. Drawing on the expertise of its own research fellows, as well as that of external specialists, both Belgian and foreign, it provides analysis and suggests international policy options that are meant to be as operational as possible. Benefiting from the role acquired by Brussels in the global arena and from the prestigious setting of the Egmont Palace, the Institute offers an ideal forum to visiting Heads of State, Heads of government, representatives of international organisations, foreign ministers and other political figures. Conferences, colloquia and seminars nurture the work of the research fellows. They also give participants the opportunity to exchange views with other specialists and with a well-informed public made up of representatives of the political, economic and academic spheres, the media and civil society. Along with research and meetings, the Institute has also developed specialised training activities, both in Brussels and abroad. It can, on request, offer specific programmes for visiting and resident diplomats and foreign professionals. Closer collaboration with other research centres, both in Belgium and in the rest of Europe and beyond, has resulted in a growing number of joint conferences and in more structured cooperation on research and publications. It has proved to be mutually beneficial and enriching.</blurb>

That is, we are a review of three things: events within Turkey; developments outside of but relevant to Turkey; and global affairs from a Turkish perspective. By &quot;Turkish perspective&quot; we mean adopting a constructive approach, with an inter-disciplinary, inclusive, in-depth and insightful attitude, while maintaining accessibility, originality and objectivity; above all making use of constructive, non-Orientalist, de-colonialist and dialogic language. Turkey lies at the center of (and is itself) a diverse geography, and the wide-ranging texts and backgrounds of our contributors reflect this. The opinions represented and conclusions drawn are those of the authors alone, and do not in any way construe endorsement by Turkish Review, its parent company, or affiliate organizations.</blurb>

It is an independent research institute within the Department of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg. We are 30 researchers who conduct and promote research on the causes, consequences and nature of Good Governance and the Quality of Government (QoG) - that is, trustworthy, reliable, impartial, uncorrupted and competent government institutions.

While Quality of Government is our common intellectual focal point, we apply a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives.

The main objective of our research is to address the theoretical and empirical problem of how political institutions of high quality can be created and maintained. A second objective is to study the effects of Quality of Government on a number of policy areas, such as health, the environment, social policy, and poverty. We approach these problems from a variety of different theoretical and methodological angles.

On a regular basis V-Dem is producing a number of different publications such as Working Papers, Country Reports and Briefs, Policy Reports and Briefs, and Thematic Reports. The V-Dem Institute is in charge of most operations relating to data collection at V-Dem Project.

V-Dem Project is a new approach to conceptualization and measurement of democracy. V-Dem has released its complete dataset as global public good, covering some 15 million data points across 173 countries. It includes about 350 unique and disaggregated democracy indicators, 34 mid-level indices, and 5 high-level indices from 1900 until today. Unlike any extant data set, V-Dem has worked with over 2,500 local and cross-national experts to provide evaluations on the many indicators on democracy. 

The dataset is the largest of its kind, enabling a vast research agenda and nuanced descriptive analyses that are comparable across time and space. In September 2016, V-Dem became the recipient of the Lijphart/Przeworski/Verba Dataset Award 2016.
